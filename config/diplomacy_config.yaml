# DIPLOMACY CONFIGURATION  â€“  MODEL 1.5
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Keeps diplomacy lightweight but believable.
#   Tracks trust between players (-100 to +100).
#   Adds penalties for early or "forced" peace.
#   NPCs and systems can reference trust values for behavior.
# ----------------------------------------------------------

diplomacy:
  # === War and Peace Effects ===
  war_trust_penalty: 40        # Trust reduction when war begins.
  peace_trust_reset: -10       # Normal trust after voluntary peace.
  forced_peace_penalty: 10     # Extra penalty for ending war too early.

  # === Timing Rules ===
  min_war_duration: 5          # War must last this many ticks before peace avoids penalty.
  peace_cooldown: 10           # Can't re-declare war for this many ticks after peace.

  # === Trust Categories (for display & AI reference) ===
  trust_thresholds:
    hostile: -50               # Below this = enemy territory.
    wary: -10                  # Uneasy peace, likely to spark again.
    neutral: 0                 # Baseline.
    friendly: 25               # Cooperative relations possible.
    ally: 50                   # Deep trust.

  # === Logging & Feedback ===
  log_events: true             # If true, game_log() records trust shifts.
  notify_players: true         # If true, send_message() tells both sides of change.
