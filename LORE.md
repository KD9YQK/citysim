# The Dawn of Bronze

Before the first walls were raised, the elders marked the earth with stones to claim their fate.  
The tribes were many then, and the rivers had no names. Every dawn brought a new fire, and every dusk, a forgotten one. The people lived by the rhythm of the hunt—until the storm that drowned a thousand huts gave birth to the art of masonry.  

From that flood rose **Nahrak**, the first builder. He said, *“A city’s heart is not its walls, but the hands that build them.”* With stone and will, he tamed the river that once devoured his kin. And when the waters bowed to him, the people called him *King of Clay*.  

But the gods do not sleep while men learn creation. Iron slumbered beneath the hills, and envy with it. The tribe of **Sareth**, who once traded stones for grain, now traded grain for bronze. Their smiths whispered to the fire, shaping envy into blades.  

The first treaty was written not in ink, but in shared hunger. Yet hunger is the cruelest ally. When the granaries of Nahrak overflowed, Sareth came under the moon’s cold silence. They brought bronze to meet bone, and legends were born.  

The battle lasted seven days. Every river remembers the blood that christened its banks. On the eighth, the gods grew silent—for men had learned their secrets.  

When Nahrak fell, his last breath was a curse and a blessing both:  
> *“The dead do not speak—but their ruins will.”*  

Generations passed. The children of the victors built new cities atop his ashes. They forgot his name but kept his craft. They raised walls higher, cast blades sharper, and told themselves they were wiser.  

Yet every hammer’s ring still echoed his warning.  
Every hearth’s glow was still the promise of civilization—and the temptation of conquest.  
And so it was said:  

> *Civilization is the art of making peace last long enough to prepare for war.*
