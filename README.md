# üèôÔ∏è CITY SIM  
**Persistent Economic & AI Simulation Engine**  
**Updated:** 2025-10-21 (Post Step 8 Completion)

---

## üìñ Overview
**City Sim** is a persistent, tick-driven simulation game modeling the **economic**, **social**, and **military** dynamics of both player- and NPC-controlled cities.  
Every game tick advances all systems ‚Äî population, economy, construction, warfare, espionage, AI, and global events ‚Äî within an asynchronous, data-driven world.

| **Espionage** | Spy training, scouting, sabotage, theft, and intel generation. | `espionage.py`, `models.py` |
| **Events & Messaging** | Central event hub with world trade events and notifications. | `events.py`, `random_events.py`, `world_events.py` |
| **Telnet Command Interface** | Async command system for player/admin control. | `telnet_server.py`, `commands.py`, `admin_commands.py` |
| **Admin Tools** | Inspect, broadcast, and modify world state. | `admin_commands.py` |
| **Logging Framework** | Unified, color-coded logger for AI, economy, and world systems. | `logger.py`, `config.yaml` |
| **Utility Functions** | YAML loaders, tick/time conversion, and helpers. | `utils.py` |

## üóÇÔ∏è Configuration & Data Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `config.yaml` | Global constants, tick timing, prestige weights, economy volatility |
| `npc_config.yaml` | AI tuning: trade thresholds, personality traits, evolution rates |
| `buildings_config.yaml` | Building definitions, production modifiers, and costs |
| `resources_config.yaml` | Canonical resource data (base price, volatility, supply) |
| `upkeep_config.yaml` | Defines per-tick costs for population, armies, and structures |
| `achievements_config.yaml` | Achievement requirements and prestige bonuses |
| `world_events_config.yaml` | Defines global market/environmental events |
| `lore.yaml` | Optional narrative flavor text |

## üåç World Trade Event System

Implemented via `world_events.py` and `world_events_config.yaml`.

Each event defines:
- **chance**  ‚Ä¢  **duration**  ‚Ä¢  **effects**  ‚Ä¢  **messages**

Effects may modify:
- `global_price_mult`
- `npc_trade_rate_mult`
- Resource-specific multipliers

### Example Events
| Event | Effect |
|--------|---------|
| **Harvest Boom** | Abundant food, reduced prices |
| **Iron Shortage** | Scarcity raises metal prices |
| **Drought Season** | Increases food/water prices |
| **Prosperity Wave** | Boosts trade and production |
| **Trade Embargo** | Reduces trade volume, increases scarcity |
| **Technological Breakthrough** | Improves efficiency, lowers costs |
| **War Mobilization** | Raises demand for metals/weapons |

All event parameters are modular and easily balanced via configuration.
